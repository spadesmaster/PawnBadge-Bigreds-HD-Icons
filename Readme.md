Adds a wide variety of HD high-contrast job icons for use with SaucyPigeon's forked Pawn Badge mod to remind you which
jobs/roles and combat/tactical preferences you have for each of your pawns.
	
Jobs are grouped and color coded: 
	
	Yellow = Dumb Labor
	Orange = Skilled Worker
	Dark Blue = Social
	Pink = Craft
	Light Blue = Tech
	Red = Combat
	Green = Gather, 
	Purple = Psycast / Rimworld of Magic
	
As an added bonus, I also added tactical unit icons from Valkyrie Chronicles.
