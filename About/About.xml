  <description>
    Adds a wide variety of HD high-contrast job icons for use with SaucyPigeon's forked Pawn Badge mod to remind you which
    jobs/roles and combat/tactical preferences you have for each of your pawns.
	
	Jobs are grouped and color coded: 
	
	Yellow = Dumb Labor
	Orange = Skilled Worker
	Dark Blue = Social
	Pink = Craft
	Light Blue = Tech
	Red = Combat
	Green = Gather, 
	Purple = Psycast / Rimworld of Magic
	
	As an added bonus, I also added tactical unit icons from Valkyrie Chronicles.

  <!--
    Adopted from Mod Manager, these next two settings are used by both vanilla and Mod Manager
    to alert the player of incorrect mod load order, and wire up the auto-sort button
    It is better to put the mod dependencies and mod load order here in About.xml, and not repeat them in Manifest.xml
    Duplicate code creates opportunity to change one but not the other, and the fewer opportunities for trouble to arise the better.
    Pre-bug hunting ounce of prevention
